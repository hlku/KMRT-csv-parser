KMRT-csv-parser
----------
A simple parser to parse the traffic volume csv data of Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit.  

This was my first `python` program which has over 100 lines. It contains some bugs and has no fool detection. It has many restrict to use this parser, in other words, it is very useless besides me.
